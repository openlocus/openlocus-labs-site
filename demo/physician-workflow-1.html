Content: **Exfoliative Dermatitis**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Erythroderma)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Exfoliative dermatitis is widespread erythema and scaling of the skin caused by preexisting**
**skin disorders, drugs, cancer, or unknown causes. Symptoms and signs are pruritus, diffuse**
**erythema, and epidermal sloughing. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment involves corticosteroids**
**and correction of the cause.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exfoliative dermatitis is a manifestation of rapid epidermal cell turnover. Its cause is unknown, but it most
often occurs in the context of preexisting skin disorders (eg, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis,
seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, pityriasis rubra pilaris), use of drugs (eg, penicillin, sulfonamides,
isoniazid, phenytoin, barbiturates), and cancer (eg, mycosis fungoides, leukemia, and, rarely, ade-
nocarcinomas). Up to 25% of patients have no identifiable underlying disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Symptoms and Signs**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Symptoms include pruritus, malaise, and chills. Diffuse erythema initially occurs in patches but spreads
and involves all or nearly all of the body. Extensive epidermal sloughing leads to abnormal
thermoregulation, nutritional deficiencies because of extensive protein losses, increased metabolic rate
with a hypercatabolic state, and hypovolemia due to transdermal fluid losses.

            Common symptoms of exfoliative dermatitis, also known as erythroderma, are primarily characterized by widespread erythema (redness) and scaling of the skin. Based on the retrieved information, the major symptoms and signs of exfoliative dermatitis include:

- Pruritus (itching)
- Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
- Chills
- Diffuse erythema, which initially occurs in patches but can spread to involve almost the entire body
- Extensive epidermal sloughing, which can lead to several systemic issues:

  - Abnormal thermoregulation due to the loss of skin barrier function
  - Nutritional deficiencies as a result of extensive protein losses
  - An increased metabolic rate with a hypercatabolic state
  - Hypovolemia (decreased blood volume) due to loss of fluid through the skin

These symptoms are due to a rapid turnover of epidermal cells and can arise from various underlying conditions such as preexisting skin disorders (e.g., atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis), adverse reactions to drugs, or in association with cancers like mycosis fungoides or leukemia. In some cases, the cause may remain unknown.

The details for the source of this information are as follows:
- **ID:** id_175_790
- **Chapter:** 7
- **Page:** 790

Treatment usually involves the use of corticosteroids and addressing the underlying cause of the condition. It is important to note that a clinical diagnosis is essential, which may be supported by a skin biopsy in some cases to differentiate exfoliative dermatitis from other similar presentations.

            Exfoliative dermatitis, also known as erythroderma, differs from other forms of dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis in its clinical presentation and underlying causes.

Clinical Presentation:
- **Exfoliative dermatitis:** It is characterized by widespread erythema (redness) and scaling that covers a large area or nearly all of the body. Other symptoms include pruritus (itching), malaise, chills, and extensive epidermal sloughing, which can lead to systemic issues such as abnormal thermoregulation, nutritional deficiencies, increased metabolic rate, and hypovolemia.
- **Atopic dermatitis:** Typically presents with chronically relapsing itchy lesions which predominantly affect the flexural areas, such as the inside of elbows or behind the knees. Dry skin is a common feature, and it is often associated with a personal or family history of other atopic disorders like asthma or hay fever.
- **Contact dermatitis:** Arises as an inflammatory reaction of the skin to irritants or allergens. Symptoms can range from itching and redness to blistering and ulceration, usually localized to areas that came into contact with the offending substance.

Underlying causes:
- **Exfoliative dermatitis:** It may result from underlying skin disorders (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis), drug reactions (e.g., to penicillin, sulfonamides, phenytoin), or malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Sometimes, the cause might be unknown.
- **Atopic dermatitis:** The causes are multifactorial, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors, skin barrier dysfunction, and immunologic responses.
- **Contact dermatitis:** Caused by direct contact with irritating substances or allergens. Irritant contact dermatitis is a nonallergic response to direct chemical injury, while allergic contact dermatitis involves an immunologic sensitization to an allergen.

Diagnosis for these dermatitis types is typically clinical, but there are cases where skin biopsy or patch testing may be utilized to ascertain the cause or to rule out other diagnoses.

Source of this information is drawn primarily from:
- **ID:** id_175_790
- **Chapter:** 7
- **Page:** 790

Furthermore, for all types of dermatitis, avoiding known irritants or allergens and managing skin hydration are common components of the treatment plan. Topical corticosteroids are commonly used in these conditions but systemic treatment may be required in severe cases such as exfoliative dermatitis.

   summary: Atopic dermatitis in children.
Content: **Introduction**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dermatitis is superficial inflammation of the skin characterized by redness, edema, oozing, crusting,
scaling, and sometimes vesicles. Pruritus is common. Eczema is a term often used interchangeably with
dermatitis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Atopic Dermatitis**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an immune-mediated inflammation of the skin arising from an**
**interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Recent research suggests that a**
**heritable epidermal barrier defect is a primary cause, and defects in the*filaggrin*gene have**
**been specifically implicated. Pruritus is the primary symptom; skin lesions range from mild**
**erythema to severe lichenification. Diagnosis is by history and examination. Treatment is**
**moisturizers, avoidance of allergic and irritant triggers, and often topical corticosteroids. Atopic**
**dermatitis frequently resolves completely by age 30.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Etiology**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AD primarily affects children in urban areas or developed countries; at least 5% of children in the US are
affected. Like asthma, it may be linked to proallergic/proinflammatory T-cell immune responses. Such
responses are becoming more common in developed countries because trends toward smaller families,
cleaner indoor environments, and early use of vaccinations and antibiotics deprive children of the early
exposure to infections and allergens that otherwise suppress proallergic T cells and thereby induce
tolerance to various antigens.

            Exfoliative dermatitis, also known as erythroderma, significantly differs from other forms of dermatitis like atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis in several ways including clinical presentation and underlying causes.

Clinical Presentation:
- **Exfoliative dermatitis** presents with pruritus (itching), diffuse erythema (widespread redness), and extensive epidermal sloughing. The condition can progress to cover nearly the entire body.
- **Atopic dermatitis** is characterized by immune-mediated inflammation of the skin, with symptoms of pruritus and lesions ranging from mild erythema to severe lichenification (thick, leathery skin). It primarily affects children, and the lesions typically occur in the flexural areas.
- **Contact dermatitis** is characterized by acute inflammation of the skin in response to irritants or allergens, causing pruritus, and skin changes that can range from redness to blistering and ulceration. It is commonly localized to the areas exposed to the irritant or allergen.

Underlying Causes:
- **Exfoliative dermatitis** can be caused by preexisting skin disorders (such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis), reaction to drugs (such as penicillin, sulfonamides, isoniazid, phenytoin), or associated with cancers like mycosis fungoides or leukemia. In some cases, the cause is unknown.
- **Atopic dermatitis** has a complex etiology including genetic and environmental factors, potential heritable epidermal barrier defects (e.g., mutations in the filaggrin gene), and immune-mediated inflammatory responses.
- **Contact dermatitis** results from direct exposure to irritants or allergens. Irritant contact dermatitis, which accounts for the majority of cases, is due to a non-specific response to chemical injury, while allergic contact dermatitis is due to an immune response to an allergen.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
- **Exfoliative dermatitis** diagnosis is clinical, with treatment involving corticosteroids and addressing the root cause.
- **Atopic dermatitis** is diagnosed through history and examination, with management including moisturizers, avoidance of allergic and irritant triggers, and often topical corticosteroids. Many cases resolve by adulthood.
- **Contact dermatitis** diagnosis involves exposure history, physical examination, and skin patch testing if allergic causes are suspected. Treatment comprises antipruritics, topical corticosteroids, and avoiding known causes.

- **Chapter:** 7 
- **Pages:** 790, 785, 788

It is worth reiterating that while atopic and contact dermatitis are specific types of eczema with directed and localized symptoms, exfoliative dermatitis is a more severe and generalized condition that involves a broad area of the skin and requires immediate medical attention.

Content: **Introduction**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dermatitis is superficial inflammation of the skin characterized by redness, edema, oozing, crusting,
scaling, and sometimes vesicles. Pruritus is common. Eczema is a term often used interchangeably with
dermatitis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Atopic Dermatitis**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an immune-mediated inflammation of the skin arising from an**
**interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Recent research suggests that a**
**heritable epidermal barrier defect is a primary cause, and defects in the*filaggrin*gene have**
**been specifically implicated. Pruritus is the primary symptom; skin lesions range from mild**
**erythema to severe lichenification. Diagnosis is by history and examination. Treatment is**
**moisturizers, avoidance of allergic and irritant triggers, and often topical corticosteroids. Atopic**
**dermatitis frequently resolves completely by age 30.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Etiology**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AD primarily affects children in urban areas or developed countries; at least 5% of children in the US are
affected. Like asthma, it may be linked to proallergic/proinflammatory T-cell immune responses. Such
responses are becoming more common in developed countries because trends toward smaller families,
cleaner indoor environments, and early use of vaccinations and antibiotics deprive children of the early
exposure to infections and allergens that otherwise suppress proallergic T cells and thereby induce
tolerance to various antigens.

          <md-block>
            Exfoliative dermatitis (also known as erythroderma) differs from other forms of dermatitis, including atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis, in both clinical presentation and underlying causes.

**Clinical Presentation:**
- **Exfoliative Dermatitis:** The key feature is widespread erythema (redness) and scaling that affect a large portion or nearly all of the body&#39;s skin. Patients may experience pruritus (itching), malaise, chills, and extensive epidermal sloughing. The skin&#39;s sloughing can cause systemic effects, such as abnormal thermoregulation, nutritional deficiencies due to protein losses, increased metabolic rate, and hypovolemia from fluid loss.
- **Atopic Dermatitis (AD):** AD presents with pruritus as the primary symptom, along with skin lesions ranging from mild erythema to severe lichenification. It usually manifests in childhood, often in flexural areas such as the inner elbows or behind the knees. Atopic dermatitis has a significant heritable component, including a potential epidermal barrier defect associated with filaggrin gene mutations.
- **Contact Dermatitis (CD):** CD is defined by acute skin inflammation as a reaction to either irritants or allergens. Patients experience pruritus, and skin changes can include erythema, blistering, and ulceration, often localized to the area of contact. Two distinct variants exist: irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), driven by direct chemical injury to the skin, and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), which results from immunologic sensitization to allergens.

**Underlying Causes:**
- **Exfoliative Dermatitis:** It can be the result of existing skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and others. It may also be induced by drugs (e.g., penicillin, isoniazid) or associated with malignancies (mycosis fungoides, leukemia). However, some cases lack identifiable causes.
- **Atopic Dermatitis:** AD is related to complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, immune responses, and skin barrier function.
- **Contact Dermatitis:** CD is directly triggered by exposure to an offending irritant or allergen.

**Treatment Approaches:**
- **Exfoliative Dermatitis:** Treatment typically involves systemic corticosteroids and addressing the underlying cause to correct the issue.
- **Atopic Dermatitis:** Management includes moisturizers, avoiding allergens and irritants, and often using topical corticosteroids.
- **Contact Dermatitis:** The primary strategy is to avoid the causes, with supplemental treatment involving antipruritics and topical corticosteroids.

The diagnosis of these conditions is largely clinical but may be aided by histological examination and patch testing, particularly in cases of contact dermatitis.

   summary: Itching causes discomfort and complications.
Content: Itching is a symptom that can cause significant discomfort and is one of the most common reasons for
consultation with a dermatologist. Itching leads to scratching, which can cause inflammation, skin
degradation, and possible secondary infection. The skin can become lichenified, scaly, and excoriated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Pathophysiology**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Itch can be prompted by diverse stimuli, including light touch, vibration, and wool fibers. There are a
number of chemical mediators as well as different mechanisms by which the sensation of itch occurs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Mediators:**Histamine is one of the most significant mediators. It is synthesized and stored in mast cells
in the skin and is released in response to various stimuli. Other mediators (eg, neuropeptides) can either
cause the release of histamine or act as pruritogens themselves, thus explaining why antihistamines
ameliorate some cases of itching and not others. Opioids have a central pruritic action as well as&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Mechanisms:**There are 4 mechanisms of itch:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Dermatologic—typically caused by inflammatory or pathologic processes (eg, urticaria, eczema)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Systemic—related to diseases of organs other than skin (eg, cholestasis)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Neuropathic—related to disorders of the CNS or peripheral nervous system (eg, multiple sclerosis)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Psychogenic—related to psychiatric conditions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intense itching stimulates vigorous scratching, which in turn can cause secondary skin conditions (eg,
inflammation, excoriation, infection), which can lead to more itching. However, scratch can temporarily
reduce the sensation of itch by activating inhibitory neuronal circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Etiology**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Itching can be a symptom of a primary skin disease or, less commonly, a systemic disease (see
Table 71-1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[**Table 71-1.**Some Causes of Itching]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Skin disorders:**Many skin disorders cause itching. The most common include&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Dry skin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Atopic dermatitis (eczema)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Contact dermatitis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Fungal skin infections&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Systemic disorders:**In systemic disorders, itching may occur with or without skin lesions. However,
when itching is prominent without any identifiable skin lesions, systemic disorders and drugs should be
considered more strongly. Systemic disorders are less often a cause of itching than skin disorders, but
some of the more common causes include

            Exfoliative dermatitis, known for its widespread erythema and scaling of the skin, can indeed be associated with systemic conditions such as malignancies and autoimmune disorders. The implications for diagnosis and management can be significant in these cases.

**Association with Malignancies:**
- Exfoliative dermatitis can be related to hematological cancers like leukemia, internal cancers, and certain types of lymphomas, such as mycosis fungoides. For example, dermatomyositis, an inflammatory muscle disease that often presents with a distinctive skin rash, is associated with an elevated risk of internal malignancies like breast, lung, ovarian, and gastrointestinal cancers. The presence of exfoliative dermatitis can sometimes signal an underlying neoplastic process, warranting a thorough investigation for possible malignancy.

**Association with Autoimmune Disorders:**
- Although the specific documents retrieved do not detail the association between exfoliative dermatitis and autoimmune disorders, the immune system is known to play a significant role in various skin conditions. Some dermatological manifestations can be linked to gluten sensitivity, as seen with dermatitis herpetiformis, and other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

**Implications for Diagnosis:**
- A diagnosis of exfoliative dermatitis should prompt clinicians to consider evaluations for systemic diseases. This may include specific diagnostic tests, imaging, and potentially, a skin biopsy to clarify the etiology. Additionally, in unexplained cases, searching for occult malignancies or autoimmune disorders is advisable.

**Implications for Management:**
- When systemic associations are identified, the management of exfoliative dermatitis will involve treating the underlying condition alongside symptomatic care for the skin. This may require integrating oncological or immunosuppressive treatments and working with a multidisciplinary team to address all aspects of the patient&#39;s health.
- Corticosteroids are often used to manage the skin inflammation, and correction of the identified cause is a key part of the treatment strategy.

The association between exfoliative dermatitis and systemic conditions underscores the need for comprehensive medical evaluation and an integrated approach to management. Physicians should remain vigilant for systemic diseases in patients presenting with exfoliative dermatitis, particularly when the condition is severe or refractory to standard dermatological treatments.

Content: **Old age:**Aging—even when disease or dietary deficiency is absent—leads to sarcopenia (progressive
loss of lean body mass), starting after age 40 and eventually amounting to a muscle loss of about 10 kg
(22 lb) in men and 5 kg (11 lb) in women. Undernutrition contributes to sarcopenia, and sarcopenia
accounts for many of the complications of undernutrition (eg, decreased nitrogen balance, increased
susceptibility to infections). Causes of sarcopenia include the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Decreased physical activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Decreased food intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Increased levels of cytokines (particularly interleukin-6)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Decreased levels of growth hormone and mechano growth factor (insulin-like growth factor-3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• In men, decreasing androgen levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aging decreases basal metabolic rate (due mainly to decreased fat-free mass), total body weight, height,
and skeletal mass; aging increases mean body fat (as a percentage of body weight) to about 30% (from
20%) in men and to 40% (from 27%) in women.

            The primary risk factors associated with undernutrition include:

1. **Inadequate Dietary Intake:** This could be due to a variety of factors, such as poverty, lack of access to food, cultural practices, or personal dietary choices.

2. **Socioeconomic Factors:** Social history elements like financial instability affecting the ability to purchase sufficient food, and issues related to the ability to shop and cook can be relevant.

3. **Old Age:** As people age, they can experience a natural decrease in muscle mass known as sarcopenia. Causes of sarcopenia related to undernutrition include decreased physical activity, decreased food intake, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and hormonal changes.

4. **Disease States:** Conditions that increase metabolic stress, such as critical illness, infection, inflammation, trauma, and surgery, can increase resting metabolic rate (RMR) and caloric needs, leading to undernutrition if these needs are not met.

5. **Impaired Immune Function:** Undernutrition can lead to a marked decline in immune function, including a decrease in total lymphocyte count and CD4+ T lymphocytes, which may further compromise nutritional status due to increased susceptibility to infections.

6. **Substance Use:** Risk factors for undernutrition include the use of drugs and alcohol, which can affect appetite, nutrient absorption, and lead to malnutrition.

7. **Chronic Disorders:** Conditions like cancer, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease can result from overnutrition but also necessitate dietary restrictions, which, if not carefully managed, can lead to undernutrition.

The key information was obtained from the following sources:
- Symptoms vary based on undernutrition causes, described in Chapter 1, on pages 15, 4, and 5
	- **ID**: id_49_70
	- **Chapter**: 1
	- **Page**:70
- A historical assessment may include questions about dietary intake and weight changes, highlighting social factors affecting nutrition

	- **Page**: 71
- Sarcopenia in older adults and factors contributing to it can affect undernutrition
	- **ID**: id_41_69
	- **Chapter**: 1
	- **Page**: 69

Recognizing and addressing these risk factors can help in the prevention and treatment of undernutrition. Ensuring adequate nutrient intake and managing sociodemographic and health-related factors are essential steps in combating undernutrition.

   summary: Vitamin deficiencies and toxicity risks.
Content: In developed countries, vitamin deficiencies result mainly from poverty, food faddism, drugs (see p. 7 and
Table 4-3), alcoholism, or prolonged and inadequately supplemented parenteral feeding. Mild vitamin
deficiency is common among frail and institutionalized elderly people who have protein-energy
undernutrition. In developing countries, deficiencies can result from lack of access to nutrients.
Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins (except vitamin B12) may develop after weeks to months of
undernutrition. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and of vitamin B12 take &gt; 1 yr to develop because the
body stores them in relatively large amounts. Intake of vitamins sufficient to prevent classic vitamin
deficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi) may not be adequate for optimum health. This area remains one of
controversy and active research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin dependency results from a genetic defect involving metabolism of a vitamin. In some cases,
vitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin
toxicity (hypervitaminosis) usually results from taking megadoses of vitamin A, D, C, B6, or niacin.

   summary: Sarcopenia in old age.
Content: **Old age:**Aging—even when disease or dietary deficiency is absent—leads to sarcopenia (progressive
loss of lean body mass), starting after age 40 and eventually amounting to a muscle loss of about 10 kg
(22 lb) in men and 5 kg (11 lb) in women. Undernutrition contributes to sarcopenia, and sarcopenia
accounts for many of the complications of undernutrition (eg, decreased nitrogen balance, increased
susceptibility to infections). Causes of sarcopenia include the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Decreased physical activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Decreased food intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Increased levels of cytokines (particularly interleukin-6)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Decreased levels of growth hormone and mechano growth factor (insulin-like growth factor-3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• In men, decreasing androgen levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aging decreases basal metabolic rate (due mainly to decreased fat-free mass), total body weight, height,
and skeletal mass; aging increases mean body fat (as a percentage of body weight) to about 30% (from
20%) in men and to 40% (from 27%) in women.

   summary: Undernutrition decreases RMR by 20%.
Content: Undernutrition can decrease RMR up to 20%. Conditions that increase metabolic stress (eg, critical
illness, infection, inflammation, trauma, surgery) can increase RMR but rarely by &gt; 50%.

   summary: Decrease in lymphocytes due to undernutrition.
Content: Total lymphocyte count, which often decreases as undernutrition progresses, may be determined.
Undernutrition causes a marked decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, so this count may not be useful in
patients who have AIDS.

   summary: Vitamin deficiencies and toxicity risks.
Content: In developed countries, vitamin deficiencies result mainly from poverty, food faddism, drugs (see p. 7 and
Table 4-3), alcoholism, or prolonged and inadequately supplemented parenteral feeding. Mild vitamin
deficiency is common among frail and institutionalized elderly people who have protein-energy
undernutrition. In developing countries, deficiencies can result from lack of access to nutrients.
Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins (except vitamin B12) may develop after weeks to months of
undernutrition. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and of vitamin B12 take &gt; 1 yr to develop because the
body stores them in relatively large amounts. Intake of vitamins sufficient to prevent classic vitamin
deficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi) may not be adequate for optimum health. This area remains one of
controversy and active research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin dependency results from a genetic defect involving metabolism of a vitamin. In some cases,
vitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin
toxicity (hypervitaminosis) usually results from taking megadoses of vitamin A, D, C, B6, or niacin.

            Aging contributes to undernutrition in the elderly population through several mechanisms:

1. **Sarcopenia:** Aging leads to sarcopenia, which is the progressive loss of lean body mass. This loss begins after age 40, with men losing about 10 kg and women about 5 kg of muscle mass over time. Sarcopenia can contribute to undernutrition as it decreases nitrogen balance and increases susceptibility to infections. Reduced physical activity, decreased food intake, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, hormonal changes, and decreased growth factors all contribute to sarcopenia.

2. **Metabolic Changes:** As people age, there is a natural decline in the basal metabolic rate (BMR), primarily due to a decrease in fat-free mass. Aging also affects overall body composition by increasing the mean body fat as a percentage of body weight, which can affect nutritional status.

3. **Decreased Nutrient Absorption:** Elderly individuals may have a reduced ability to absorb nutrients due to changes in the digestive system, contributing to undernutrition.

4. **Chronic Health Conditions:** Older adults often have chronic health conditions that can affect appetite, alter metabolism, or increase nutrient needs, leading to an imbalance between nutrient intake and the body&#39;s demands.

5. **Social and Economic Factors:** The elderly might face social and economic barriers to obtaining adequate nutrition, including financial constraints, lack of access to nutritious food, or reduced ability to shop and prepare meals.

6. **Altered Sensory Perception:** Changes in taste and smell can decrease the desire to eat, leading to reduced food intake and possible undernutrition.

7. **Medications:** Elderly people often take multiple medications that could interfere with nutrient absorption or appetite.

The document information provides a detailed perspective on how aging contributes to undernutrition:

	- **Chapter**: 1
	- **Page**: 69

Addressing undernutrition in the elderly requires a multifaceted approach that includes nutritional support, management of chronic health conditions, and addressing social and economic issues that limit access to nutritious food. Monitoring for sarcopenia and providing interventions such as physical activity programs and adequate nutrition can help prevent the progression of undernutrition in the elderly population.
